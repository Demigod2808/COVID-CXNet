Detecting the novel coronavirus (aka 2019-nCov or COVID-19) from frontal chest X-ray images 
using deep convolutional neural nets

## Data Collection
Chest X-ray Images of patients with PCR-positive COVID-19 are collected from different sources, such as [SIRM](https://www.sirm.org/category/senza-categoria/covid-19/).
Please cite this repo if you are using CXR images:

There are currently **~450** images with different sizes and formats, and the data will be updated regularly. Metadata will be added as soon. **This dataset is the largest to best of my knowledge, as of 15/May/2020.** Normal CXRs are collected from different datasets, without a pediatric image bias.
